            Snail Mail started during the pandemic, when there was a need for community and 
            a space to relax while making friends on campus. It started as just one letter 
            (from Emily‚Äôs mailbox to Jess‚Äô mailbox in page-rob)üêåüì¨, then turned into a 
            full-blown effort to promote letter-writing, bullet journaling, and love for 
            stationery on Brown‚Äôs campus! 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Together with an extremely creative and dedicated team, Emily's vision was brought to life with Snail Mail @ Brown!

            Founded in February of 2022, Snail Mail has nearly quadrupled 
            in membership since its creation just two years ago. The organization has 
            collaborated with several organizations such as Create @ Brown, Birbs @ Brown, 
            and Brown's Campus Center to plan exciting events for students.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>We hope to continue to spread the love of journaling and memory collecting 
            with the students of Brown and RISD as we continue to grow as a community.
