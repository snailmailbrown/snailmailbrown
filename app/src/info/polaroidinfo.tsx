      "Our lovely e-board at our end of year social! With so many events over the school year came soooooo many stickers. Too many. Actually, that’s a lie. You can never have too many stickers. However, with finals rounding the corner, we got our Snails together for a fun night of tote bag painting, boba, and sticker giveaways! Our final event of the year was filled with laughter, creativity, socializing between snails, and a couple of freebies for our Snail Mail community <3.",
